# LinkedIn Job Scraper

This is a Python script that scrapes data from the LinkedIn website and saves it to a CSV file. It uses the Requests and Beautiful Soup libraries for web scraping, and the pandas library for data processing. It also incorporates automation by scheduling the script to run at specific intervals using the schedule library.

## Requirements

To run this script, you need to have Python 3 and the following libraries installed:

- Requests
- Beautiful Soup
- pandas
- schedule

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install requests
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install pandas
pip install schedule
```

## Usage

To use this script, you need to specify the URL of the website to scrape, which is currently set to:

```python
url = "https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?keywords=software%20development"
```

You can change this URL to any other LinkedIn job search page that you want to scrape.

You also need to specify the time interval for running the script, which is currently set to:

```python
schedule.every().day.at("10:00").do(scrape_data)
```

This means that the script will run every day at 10:00 AM. You can change this time to any other valid value, such as "09:30", "12:00", or "23:59".

To run the script, simply execute it from the command line:

```bash
python linkedin_job_scraper.py
```

The script will scrape the data from the website and save it to a CSV file named "linkedin_jobs.csv" in the same directory. It will also print a message indicating the status of the scraping process.

## Output

The output CSV file will contain the following columns:

- Title: The job title
- Company: The company name
- Location: The job location
- Description: The job description
- URL: The job URL
